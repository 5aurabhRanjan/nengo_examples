Miscellaneous examples
**********************

This directory contains examples that do not belong in any of the other folders
or that are only tangentially related to modeling with Nengo.

Requirements
============

You will need Python installed with the following packages for the Jupyter
Notebook examples:

- `nengo <http://pythonhosted.org/nengo/getting_started.html#installation>`_
- `jupyter <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_

Usage
=====

To run the notebooks,
`start the Jupyter notebook
<http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html>`_
and navigate to this directory.
Click on the ``.ipynb`` file you wish to run.
The notebook cells contain the relevant code,
so you only need to run those cells.
